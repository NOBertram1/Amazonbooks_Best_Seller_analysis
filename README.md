# Amazonbooks_Best_Seller_analysis

In this project, the best selling boks from the year 2009 to 2019 was scrapped from the Amazon website using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
Then analysis was carried out on the data and the insights were recorded.
A report of the project was also provided in the repo titled " Analyzing Amazonâ€™s Best Selling Books: Uncovering Trends and Insights in the World of Literature."
Suitable visualizations were made as well.

This is part of the Hamoye Data Storytelling internship Stage E project
